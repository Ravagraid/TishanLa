## Introduction {#introduction}

&emsp;The Empire of Tishan'La is a sovereign, interstellar nation state that spans three solar systems, or [Spheres](_pages/Locations/Stellar/three-spheres.md) thus far, with plans to expand further afield into what has commonly been called the [Far Realms](_pages/Locations/Stellar/far-realms.md), a zone of space that surrounds the Empire proper, and is home to a myriad of rumours, secrets, and other creatures that dwell within the vastness of the void. The population of the Empire is a topic of debate, as while a census had been conducted in the past, certain clerical errors, Byzantine bureaucracy and the destruction of important records has led to only an approximation of their number. While wildly disputed, the most accurate estimate is between 39 and 40 billion souls.

&emsp;The government functions much like a feudal empire, where power is supremely held by the [Lord Imperatorius](_pages/Titles_Ranks/lord_imperatorius.md) first, then trickled down to the many ranks beneath the title bearer. While this system might mirror the governments of old in many respects, the Empire is still more centralised than its appearance might suggest, as, per royal decree, a census of each region is undertaken every [Decia](_pages/Calendars/tishanlani_calendar.md), or decade, to ensure that the funds of the [Throneworld](_pages/Locations/Stellar/Planets/tishanla-world.md) are spent only in areas where it is most necessary to do so.

&emsp;Due to the nature of governing such a vast territory, the Empire functions through a form of tithe, or taxation, in which shoe nobles of the [Lords Proliferate](_pages/Organisations/Political/lords-proliferate.md) must pay a tax. This tax can be given in many ways, determined by the needs of the Empire, and the whims of its ruler, whether it be material wealth, a labour force, or even through a form of conscription. Those that do not are swiftly rebuked, and in prior epochs, such disdainful behaviour has even brought about reproach of a most violent nature, to instil fear, or to install another noble in place of the old. This has led to many a regional regime change, through are loath to admit to such a thing.

&emsp;One area of note is its people, the stalward shianlani, or [Tishan'La'Ni](_pages/Ethnicities/tishanlani.md), in their local tongue. They are a people born of hard times and harsher conditions, as due to the fragmented nature of both their realm, and their many cultures,disputes often run rampant, if left unchecked. Despite such obvious shortcomings, they as a people believe in the unity of the nation above even cultural, or ethnic identity. They may have a streak of independence about them, but it is this unity of purpose, this collective pride in themselves as a nation, that allows them to see past such petty squabbles, when necessary.

## General Information {#general}

### Motto {#motto}

&emsp;"Once We Fell, Now We Rise!" - If one were to look upon the heraldry of Tishan'La, they would see these words, bold and brazen beneath the three rising suns. It is a statement about their past, about their fall from grace, and their claim to rise not only onto the pedestal they once occupied, but to go beyond even that, into the heavens themselves.

### Recognised Ethnicities {#ethnicities}

&emsp;While listing every ethnicity within the empire might be an impossible task, due to just how many groups exist within the empires borders, the shared identity of the empire is [Tishan'La'Ni](_pages/Ethnicities/tishanlani.md), though often this is conflated with national identity, or as some would say; "I may be Ceehur, but I am Tishan'La'Ni, same as you."

&emsp;Beyond beloning to the empire's group, some cultures have persisted since before their absorption into the empire proper, such as the Kahlkili, whose cultural ties to their [Great Tapestry](_pages/Documents/great-tapestry.md) defy the understanding of the most experienced scholars. Though perhaps the most prominent divide in their culture, is that of [The Hive](_pages/Ethnicities/the-hive.md), and [The Hiveless](_pages/Ethnicities/hiveless.md), whose constant internal struggles often leave carnage in their wake.

&emsp;Contrasting these otherwise centralised cultural identities, the Yialei are, by their nature, fragmentary, with each flock holding its own ties, its own customs, and its own ceremonies. In some cases, even their own version of the greater Yiale tongue, which for the sake of completeness, is known as [Yiaiasian](_pages/Languages/yiaiasian.md), or "Sounds of the Yia."

### Organisational Structure {#org-structure}

&emsp;As has been mentioned before, power within the empire is exercised from the highest authority, then channelled through other organisations, individuals, and positions of note to affect real change upon its many peoples. The structure of the empire, in broad strokes, can be laid out as follows;

- **[Lord Imperatorius](_pages/Titles_Ranks/lord_imperatorius.md):** The highest seat of power, rule undisputed and guardian of the Empire in action, if not in name. Whomsoever holds this title is granted the remit to write laws, conduct vast scientific, economic, and political projects without equal. It is a title held only by those who can unify an Empire, and those that wish for such a thing, do so with an envy unparalleled.
- **[The Council Empyrean](_pages/Organisations/Political/council-empyrean.md):** The upkeep of an empire is no small task, and certainly impossible for just a single individual to manage, thus, the Lord Imperatorius has a council of trusted advisors, chosen principally for their integrity and prior sacrifices made for the nation. There are seven members of the council in total, with each having a distinct title and responsibility both to the state, and to the Lord Imperatorius. Over informal channels, the Council is often referred to as the Keepers, as they are the guardians of Tishan'La, from its majestics heights, to its disastrous follies.
  - **[Keeper Of Visions](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-visions.md):** Responsible for the infrastructure, construction and manufacturing pursuits, including extra-solar stations and other artificial constructs. When a great structure is established in the influence of a Sphere, or Wanderer, it is typically the responsibility of this Keeper to ensure that such matters are handled with an eye towards perfection, and expediency. Currently, the reformation of infrastructure on the Throneworld takes up most, if not all of their time.
  - **[Keeper Of Bulwarks](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-bulwarks.md):** Sovereign nations, by their very nature, are little more than concepts without the presence of a military arm, or defensive measure. The Keeper of Bulwarks, then, is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and development of such a military presence, that allows for the projection of power beyond the Empires borders, and peacekeeping within. Currently, these defence initiatives have suffered from a severe lack of funding, due in part to a relatively lengthy period of peace.
  - **[Keeper Of Labour](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-labour.md):** While one might consider a humble profession like farming to be far below them, or the ignoble cistern worker to be nothing short of a deplorable position to be in, it is too often the case that these jobs are necessary to the running of a functioning maintained society. Such tasks and many more that are needed, but not wanted, are under the purview of this Keeper, and while misunderstood by those of a higher social stratum, they are nonetheless Tishan'La'Ni deserving of acknowledgement, and respect, on the part of the Council.
  - **[Keeper Of Paths](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-paths.md):** Some might consider the lauded [Pioneers](_pages/Organisations/Civil/pioneers.md) and their many accomplishments to be little more than relics of a bygone age, where the establishment of commerce and great constructions to further the aims of other, more important areas of Tishan'La'Ni society. This, of course, would be wrong. The Pioneers, through careful handling of their assets and displacement, have proven time and again to be a valuable resource, and thus was the position of the Paths created, to better guide this wayward group to new, ever expanding horizons.
  - **[Keeper Of Voices](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-voices.md):** Before the most recent attempt on the Lord Imperatorius' life, there were but six seats to the Council Empyrean, which is, at least in part, what lead to the attempt in the first place. The Council had no dedicated position relating to spycraft, subterfuge or obfuscation. This was soon rectified both with the expansion of the Council, and the formation of a secretive society, whose purpose was to ensure a measure of compliance and surveillance amongst the higher echelons of society.
  - **[Keeper Of Coin](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-coin.md):** Perhaps the most clearly defined role of all the council, the Keeper of Coin's principle responsibility is the understanding of market dynamics, commercial forces, and oversight of commerce. Through this seat, the Empire maintains its treasury, independent of its reliance on [The Tithe](_pages/Rituals-Traditions/tithe.md). Curiously, this position is given to nobility who have a penchant for discretion, rather than the grandiose or ostentatious.
  - **[Keeper Of Beasts](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-beasts.md):** In truth, this is a position of yesteryear, when Tishan'La held a more aggressive stance towards those that did not conform to societal norms, whether they be the nations own, or those curious creatures that came from the Far Realms and beyond. The exact nature of this position is known only to the Keeper themselves, and to the Lord Imperatorius, who has in some cases, taken to calling the holder, The Tamer.
- **[Lords Proliferate](_pages/Organisations/Political/lords-proliferate.md):** These lords number just short of a thousand, each holding hereditary titles or claims over territory, and function much like feudal lords of yore. While individually, the Lords are granted autonomy second only to the Council, their power is kept in check by clandestine Bondsmen, as envoys or emissaries of the Empyrean itself.
- **[Council Bondsmen](_pages/Organisations/bondsmen.md):** One of the more curious aspects of TIshan'La'Ni society is that from a social standing, the countless Lords of the vast territories of Titian la are held in as much regard as the Council Bondsmen themselves. This may be in part due to the fact that the Council Bounds are chosen by the Empyrean Lords, and thus hold a certain amount of protection from the free reign of other, more noble powers.<br>
  &emsp;Bondsmen are, as their name would suggest, bound to a specific duty through a contract verbal, written, or etheric, depending on the gravity of their given station. While bondsmen exist in all corners of society, there remains a group who through simple dedication to their work, and to the work of the Empire as a whole, have been recognised by beings as prestigious as the Empyreans themselves.
- **The Commonfolk:** Beneath the nobility and their air of authority, beneath the dizzying heights of Imperial bureaucracy, exists the commonfolk, the multitudes of man whose very existence is the backbone of the Empire. They are they craftsman, the merchant, the common soldiery, they are the everyman that call Tishan'La their home.
  - Bondsmen: While they aren't a distinct social classs unto themselves, unlike the Councilmen, as some have taken to calling them, Bondsmen are no less important. In simple terms, they are commonfolk who through similar contracts to their Councilmen peers, have rendered themselves as servants, or subjects, of another. There can many any numbers of reasons for this, from paying off debts to prove ones worth, yet one thing remains constant to a Bondsman; their position is temporary.
  - Beasts: What minority of the population constitutes beasts are perhaps the single-worst kept secret of all Tishan'La. They are a class of people that, for all intents and purposes, is ignored by every other. They are the conquered, the enslaved, the self-destructive who gave up everything. It is often said that only those in positions of power would even dare to have Beasts, do to the implications involved. In fact, rumours have spread of the Lord Imperatorius and his more.. Devious tendencides in this regard.

### Culture {#culture}

&emsp;Tishan'La'Ni society is, as one might garner from the two-faced nature of the Empire and its people, a conflicting mess of cultural norms and ancient tradition that constantly clashes with a new, modern age. The current status quo is rather simple; to change the present state, one must conform to it, to understand its strengths and weaknesses. In even simpler terms, don't rock the boat, build a better one out of the same hull. The cultural identity of Tishan'La can be broken down into three distinct pillars, each typified by one of the [Three Spheres](_pages/Locations/Stellar/three-spheres.md) that rule the skies of the Empire.

&emsp;The first is Fauhs, or Pride. This can be pride in ones self, pride in ones family, or pride in the empire, but above all else it is pride in accomplishments and self-sacrifice, whilst selfishness is generally looked down upon. This has, in turn, brought about a generational of recent years, with the young being given the mercy of not knowing the sacrifice of certain values to merely survive in hostile, violent times. This gap between the two is unlikely to ever be closed, with the younger having warped this pillar into pride in ones self for selfless acts, while the old take pride in the accomplishments of the greater collective whole.

&emsp;The second pillar of Suaed, or Compassion, might at first seem opposed to Fauhs, as those incapable of helping themselves would have little hope in a land of self-sacrifice for a greater whole. However, compassion comes in many forms, and it is only through dedication that one can prosper, and thus show mercy to others by sharing what surplus they have. It is commonplace, though not mandatory, for households to perform acts of charity without the need for fanfare or grand gestures of benevolence. This isn't always the case, however, as the desire to provide for ones fellow man is often supplanted by the needs of the nation. That being said, perhaps that is the purpose of Suaed, to encourage the commonfolk to care more for ones fellows, so that those in power might play their role more effectively.

&emsp;Lastly is the pillar of Gaieh, which doesn't translate directly, but has roots in the words for Honour, or Duty, depending on where one asks. This pillar refers to the acts that one undertakes, and where they are placed upon an unwritten scale of selfish to selfless. Unlike the prior pillars, Gaieh holds a universal appeal and reverence, due precisely to its vague nature. This has, just as with Fauhs and Suaed, lended itself to the vast divide of generations, with the young seeking duty to further ones self and standing, while the older hold familial ties to be more important. As with all things in Tishan'La, this divide is only temporarily reconciled, when both ideals are threatened by an outside force.

### Public Agenda {#agenda}

&emsp;At present, the empire promotes, in near totality, a regime of growth, expansion, and reformation through targeted expenditures of wealth in the pursuit of well-defined goals. The reasoning is fairly simple; to concentrate efforts where they are most needed, as opposed to casting a wide net over all areas of concern. This is so as to allow for the shoring up of the most neglected areas, before other, less pressing matters are addressed.

&emsp;Where some polities would choose to hoard their wealth within lavish ivory towers, gilded in all manner of shining metals and glittering jewels, the Empyreans use the wealth of the nation to further improve the lives of those within it. Or to suppress dissidents that seek to destabilise the Empire.

&emsp;It is said that the gears of imperial mandate grind ever so slowly, and they would be correct, as those afore mentioned to organise the most pressing matters, take place every half-decia, or five years, before the start of the [Starbinding Festival](_pages/Rituals-Traditions/starbinding-festival.md).

## Historical {#historical}

### Founders {#founders}

The Founder of the empire in its present state is [Levariel Demorial](_pages/Characters/Major/levariel_demorial.md).

### History {#history}

&emsp;It is often said that history, no matter how torturous, no matter how humiliating or mundane, no matter the horrors of endless conflict and the death toll of countless different ideologies that, through the simple fact of their very existence, is somehow written by the victor.

&emsp;Theirs his a history painted red, dripping with an ever-present flow of crimson from conflict that reaches back tens of thousands of solar years, by the calendar of the empire. It is layer upon layer of battleground, unearthed weaponry, and failed attempts at landing a last decisive blow in a conflict that lasted for much, much longer than it had any right to.

&emsp;As one might have surmised form such strong, emotive language, the notion that one can garner an unbiased view of the history of such a resilient people should be considered impossible. That is, if it weren't for one of the lesser-known duties of the Keeper of Paths; the safeguarding of knowledge, and the sanctification of what one might consider to be the only true history of the Empire. It is thanks to this that there exists, in any form, accounts of those fateful conflicts of yesteryear. However, as is often the case with the passage of time, the further back one ventures, the less precise the account becomes.

&emsp;What history is known, is suffixed with the denomination of [Beah Eahzhusa](_pages/Calendars/tishanlani_calendar.md), or when properly translated, Before the Era of Rebuilding, and thus abbreviated as BER (Before Era of Rebuilding) to understand the timescales involved. For further reading on the subject, see; [A History of Tishan'La](_pages/Documents/history-tishanla.md).

## Geopolitical {#geopolitical}

### Power Structure {#power-structure}

&emsp;As a nation state, Tishan'La can be described as a Unitary, Autocratic state in which political power is concentrated from the top down. The Lord Imperatorius, then, can be described as an appointed Dictator, who earned his position through unifying the disparate peoples of his world, after a cataclysmic conflict.

&emsp;Directly under him is a complex web of organisations headed by the Council Empyrean, which act the hands of the Lord in their respective fields, and thus govern the more mundane aspects of the empire. Appointment to these positions can be described as Meritocratic, as each Keeper is appointed on their deeds alone, and by the Lord Imperatorius, alone.

&emsp;The Lords Proliferate, however, are an organisation of one thousand Lords and Ladies that hold hereditary titles, lands, and honours. The origin of these accolades is mostly unknown, with many such honorifics heralding from a time before the current Lord Imperatorius, and his prodigiously long reign.

### Economic System {#economics}

&emsp;Rather curiously, Tishan'La uses a market economy, bolstered by a regulartory body known as the [Zhendra Determinancy](_pages/Organisations/Civil/zhendra-determinancy.md), under the Keeper Of Coin as a contingency to keep bad actors from the pursuit of monopolisation. As a result of this free market, certain innovations were made to capitalise on the notion of supply and demand to make transactions easier, giving rise to the [Accredation Mark](_pages/Technologies/accredation-mark.md)

### Official Currency {#currency}

&emsp;There is only one currency that holds value within the Empire, that being the [Imperial [Skar](_pages/Item/Currency/imperial-skar.md)], with its plural form being the Skarii (Scar-E). A single Skar is the lowest denomination of currency, and is counted in units of [12](_pages/Misc/counting-system.md), much like other systems of measurement that the empire uses. The Skar is back by what's known as the [Shardrask Standard](_pages/Materials/shardrask.md), wherein the value of the currency is based upon the finite reserves of such material, within the Empires labyrinthine vaults. Below is a table denoting the unit sizes of Skar, and their rough purchasing power, outside factors not withstanding;

### Legislative Body {#legislative}

&emsp;Chiefly, the Lords Proliferate function as the body which drafts new laws into existence. This process can be explained briefly;

1. &emsp;Every six years, laws are drafted by individual Lords, and support is gathered to present these drafts at what is called the [Sexennial Gathering](_pages\Rituals-Traditions\sexennial-gathering.md).
2. &emsp;Should the draft garner approval of one tenth of the assembled Lords, the work comes the scrutiny of the remaining ninth, as those in support are expected to have read, understood, and found no flaw in the proposal.
3. &emsp;During the process, there will always be at least one redraft, and if needed, as many as are required to redress any inconsistencies, or errors. These redrafts, perplexingly, can often take longer than the six-year period before being ready to be voted upon.
4. &emsp;Upon completing the Clarification process, the proposal is put before the Upper House, which totals one twentieth of the whole, who put it to a two-thirds vote. If it passes, then the proposal is ratified into Imperial Law, as yet one more regulation within the great apparatus.
