## Introduction {#introduction}

&emsp;The Empire of Tishan'La is a sovereign, interstellar nation state that spans three solar systems, or [Spheres](_pages/Locations/Stellar/three-spheres.md) thus far, with plans to expand further afield into what has commonly been called the [Far Realms](_pages/Locations/Stellar/far-realms.md), a zone of space that surrounds the Empire proper, and is home to a myriad of rumours, secrets, and other creatures that dwell within the vastness of the void. The population of the Empire is a topic of debate, as while a census had been conducted in the past, certain clerical errors, Byzantine bureaucracy and the destruction of important records has led to only an approximation of their number. While wildly disputed, the most accurate estimate is between 39 and 40 billion souls.

&emsp;The government functions much like a feudal empire, where power is supremely held by the [Lord Imperatorius](_pages/Titles_Ranks/lord_imperatorius.md) first, then trickled down to the many ranks beneath the title bearer. While this system might mirror the governments of old in many respects, the Empire is still more centralised than its appearance might suggest, as, per royal decree, a census of each region is undertaken every [Decia](_pages/Calendars/tishanlani_calendar.md), or decade, to ensure that the funds of the [Throneworld](_pages/Locations/Stellar/Planets/tishanla-world.md) are spent only in areas where it is most necessary to do so.

&emsp;Due to the nature of governing such a vast territory, the Empire functions through a form of tithe, or taxation, in which shoe nobles of the [Lords Proliferate](_pages/Organisations/Political/lords-proliferate.md) must pay a tax. This tax can be given in many ways, determined by the needs of the Empire, and the whims of its ruler, whether it be material wealth, a labour force, or even through a form of conscription. Those that do not are swiftly rebuked, and in prior epochs, such disdainful behaviour has even brought about reproach of a most violent nature, to instil fear, or to install another noble in place of the old. This has led to many a regional regime change, through are loath to admit to such a thing.

&emsp;One area of note is its people, the stalward shianlani, or [Tishan'La'Ni](_pages/Ethnicities/tishanlani.md), in their local tongue. They are a people born of hard times and harsher conditions, as due to the fragmented nature of both their realm, and their many cultures,disputes often run rampant, if left unchecked. Despite such obvious shortcomings, they as a people believe in the unity of the nation above even cultural, or ethnic identity. They may have a streak of independence about them, but it is this unity of purpose, this collective pride in themselves as a nation, that allows them to see past such petty squabbles, when necessary.

## General Information {#general}

### Motto {#motto}

&emsp;"Once We Fell, Now We Rise!" - If one were to look upon the heraldry of Tishan'La, they would see these words, bold and brazen beneath the three rising suns. It is a statement about their past, about their fall from grace, and their claim to rise not only onto the pedestal they once occupied, but to go beyond even that, into the heavens themselves.

### Recognised Ethnicities {#ethnicities}

&emsp;While listing every ethnicity within the empire might be an impossible task, due to just how many groups exist within the empires borders, the shared identity of the empire is [Tishan'La'Ni](_pages/Ethnicities/tishanlani.md), though often this is conflated with national identity, or as some would say; "I may be Ceehur, but I am Tishan'La'Ni, same as you."

&emsp;Beyond beloning to the empire's group, some cultures have persisted since before their absorption into the empire proper, such as the Kahlkili, whose cultural ties to their [Great Tapestry](_pages/Documents/great-tapestry.md) defy the understanding of the most experienced scholars. Though perhaps the most prominent divide in their culture, is that of [The Hive](_pages/Ethnicities/the-hive.md), and [The Hiveless](_pages/Ethnicities/hiveless.md), whose constant internal struggles often leave carnage in their wake.

&emsp;Contrasting these otherwise centralised cultural identities, the Yialei are, by their nature, fragmentary, with each flock holding its own ties, its own customs, and its own ceremonies. In some cases, even their own version of the greater Yiale tongue, which for the sake of completeness, is known as [Yiaiasian](_pages/Languages/yiaiasian.md), or "Sounds of the Yia."

### Organisational Structure {#structure}

&emsp;As has been mentioned before, power within the empire is exercised from the highest authority, then channelled through other organisations, individuals, and positions of note to affect real change upon its many peoples. The structure of the empire, in broad strokes, can be laid out as follows;

- **[Lord Imperatorius](_pages/Titles_Ranks/lord_imperatorius.md):** The highest seat of power, rule undisputed and guardian of the Empire in action, if not in name. Whomsoever holds this title is granted the remit to write laws, conduct vast scientific, economic, and political projects without equal. It is a title held only by those who can unify an Empire, and those that wish for such a thing, do so with an envy unparalleled.
- **[The Council Empyrean](_pages/Organisations/Political/council-empyrean.md):** The upkeep of an empire is no small task, and certainly impossible for just a single individual to manage, thus, the Lord Imperatorius has a council of trusted advisors, chosen principally for their integrity and prior sacrifices made for the nation. There are seven members of the council in total, with each having a distinct title and responsibility both to the state, and to the Lord Imperatorius. Over informal channels, the Council is often referred to as the Keepers, as they are the guardians of Tishan'La, from its majestics heights, to its disastrous follies.
  - **[Keeper Of Visions](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-visions.md):** Responsible for the infrastructure, construction and manufacturing pursuits, including extra-solar stations and other artificial constructs. When a great structure is established in the influence of a Sphere, or Wanderer, it is typically the responsibility of this Keeper to ensure that such matters are handled with an eye towards perfection, and expediency. Currently, the reformation of infrastructure on the Throneworld takes up most, if not all of their time.
  - **[Keeper Of Bulwarks](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-bulwarks.md):** Sovereign nations, by their very nature, are little more than concepts without the presence of a military arm, or defensive measure. The Keeper of Bulwarks, then, is responsible for the establishment, maintenance, and development of such a military presence, that allows for the projection of power beyond the Empires borders, and peacekeeping within. Currently, these defence initiatives have suffered from a severe lack of funding, due in part to a relatively lengthy period of peace.
  - **[Keeper Of Labour](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-labour.md):** While one might consider a humble profession like farming to be far below them, or the ignoble cistern worker to be nothing short of a deplorable position to be in, it is too often the case that these jobs are necessary to the running of a functioning maintained society. Such tasks and many more that are needed, but not wanted, are under the purview of this Keeper, and while misunderstood by those of a higher social stratum, they are nonetheless Tishan'La'Ni deserving of acknowledgement, and respect, on the part of the Council.
  - **[Keeper Of Paths](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-paths.md):** Some might consider the lauded [Pioneers](_pages/Organisations/Civil/pioneers.md) and their many accomplishments to be little more than relics of a bygone age, where the establishment of commerce and great constructions to further the aims of other, more important areas of Tishan'La'Ni society. This, of course, would be wrong. The Pioneers, through careful handling of their assets and displacement, have proven time and again to be a valuable resource, and thus was the position of the Paths created, to better guide this wayward group to new, ever expanding horizons.
  - **[Keeper Of Voices](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-voices.md):** Before the most recent attempt on the Lord Imperatorius' life, there were but six seats to the Council Empyrean, which is, at least in part, what lead to the attempt in the first place. The Council had no dedicated position relating to spycraft, subterfuge or obfuscation. This was soon rectified both with the expansion of the Council, and the formation of a secretive society, whose purpose was to ensure a measure of compliance and surveillance amongst the higher echelons of society.
  - **[Keeper Of Coin](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-coin.md):** Perhaps the most clearly defined role of all the council, the Keeper of Coin's principle responsibility is the understanding of market dynamics, commercial forces, and oversight of commerce. Through this seat, the Empire maintains its treasury, independent of its reliance on [The Tithe](_pages/Rituals-Traditions/tithe.md). Curiously, this position is given to nobility who have a penchant for discretion, rather than the grandiose or ostentatious.
  - **[Keeper Of Beasts](_pages/Titles_Ranks/keeper-beasts.md):** In truth, this is a position of yesteryear, when Tishan'La held a more aggressive stance towards those that did not conform to societal norms, whether they be the nations own, or those curious creatures that came from the Far Realms and beyond. The exact nature of this position is known only to the Keeper themselves, and to the Lord Imperatorius, who has in some cases, taken to calling the holder, The Tamer.
